## Git

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) specification for all commit messages.


## Communication Style

- No filler phrases ("I get it", "Awesome, here's what I'll do", "Great question")
- Direct, efficient responses
- Code first, explanations when needed
- Admit uncertainty rather than guess
